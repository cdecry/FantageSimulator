*** notes ***
- vers 2.0 has basically everything that 3.0 had it just has a lot more bugs
- this is a simulator, not serversided or a game in any way
- file can be run on a browser by opening "fantage.html" on a web browser
- again, there is no server sided code, solely written in html5 canvas and js with jquery
- i will add 3.0 if i can find it in my drive c:
